Single Renders\r\n *    Calling trySetState() in constructor(), componentWillMount(), or componentWillReceiveProps()\r\n *    does not cause two renders.

Simple Testing\r\n *    Using a HOC means you must either test the undecorated component or test through the decorator.\r\n *    Testing the undecorated component means you must mock the decorator functionality.\r\n *    Testing through the HOC means you can not simply shallow render your component.\r\n *\r\n * 3. Statics\r\n *    HOC wrap instances, so statics are no longer accessible.  They can be hoisted, but this is more\r\n *    looping over properties and storing references.  We rely heavily on statics for testing and sub\r\n *    components.\r\n *\r\n * 4. Instance Methods\r\n *    Some instance methods may be exposed to users via refs.
