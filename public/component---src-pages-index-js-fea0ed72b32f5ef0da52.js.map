Single Renders\r\n\t *    Calling trySetState() in constructor(), componentWillMount(), or componentWillReceiveProps()\r\n\t *    does not cause two renders. Consumers and tests do not have to wait two renders to get state.\r\n\t *    See www.react.run/4kJFdKoxb/27 for an example of this issue.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * 2. Simple Testing\r\n\t *    Using a HOC means you must either test the undecorated component or test through the decorator.\r\n\t *    Testing the undecorated component means you must mock the decorator functionality.\r\n\t *    Testing through the HOC means you can not simply shallow render your component.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * 3. Statics\r\n\t *    HOC wrap instances, so statics are no longer accessible.  They can be hoisted, but this is more\r\n\t *    looping over properties and storing references.  We rely heavily on statics for testing and sub\r\n\t *    components.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * 4. Instance Methods\r\n\t *    Some instance methods may be exposed to users via refs.

Single Renders\r\n *    Calling trySetState() in constructor(), componentWillMount(), or componentWillReceiveProps()\r\n *    does not cause two renders. Consumers and tests do not have to wait two renders to get state.\r\n *    See www.react.run/4kJFdKoxb/27 for an example of this issue.\r\n *\r\n * 2. Simple Testing\r\n *    Using a HOC means you must either test the undecorated component or test through the decorator.\r\n *    Testing the undecorated component means you must mock the decorator functionality.\r\n *    Testing through the HOC means you can not simply shallow render your component.\r\n *\r\n * 3. Statics\r\n *    HOC wrap instances, so statics are no longer accessible.  They can be hoisted, but this is more\r\n *    looping over properties and storing references.  We rely heavily on statics for testing and sub\r\n *    components.\r\n *\r\n * 4. Instance Methods\r\n *    Some instance methods may be exposed to users via refs.  Again, these are lost with HOC unless\r\n *    hoisted and exposed by the HOC.\r\n */\r\nvar getAutoControlledStateValue = exports.getAutoControlledStateValue = function getAutoControlledStateValue(propName, props, state) {\r\n  var includeDefaults = arguments.length > 3 && arguments[3] !== undefined ? arguments[3] : false;\r\n\r\n  // regular props\r\n  var propValue = props[propName];\r\n  if (propValue !== undefined) return propValue;\r\n\r\n  if (includeDefaults) {\r\n    // defaultProps\r\n    var defaultProp = props[getDefaultPropName(propName)];\r\n    if (defaultProp !== undefined) return defaultProp;\r\n\r\n    // initial state - state may be null or undefined\r\n    if (state) {\r\n      var initialState = state[propName];\r\n      if (initialState !== undefined) return initialState;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // React doesn't allow changing from uncontrolled to controlled components,\r\n  // default checked/value if they were not present.\r\n  if (propName === 'checked') return false;\r\n  if (propName === 'value') return props.multiple ?
